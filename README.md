# Task3
The task was to write a script that reads a list of dice from the command line, generates a probability table for the sum of the dice, and simulates a game where the player rolls the dice and tries to guess the sum of the dice. But thereÂ´s a twist, the dice game should be a generalized non-transitive dice game. The script should be able to run in the console.
